hello how are you?
I am fine. Thank you!
mixing for-each loop and for loop in 2d array
int[][] twod = {{5, 9, 2}, {7, 1, 3}};

int i = 0;

for(var x : twod){
  i = 0;//reset i here
  while(i < x.length){//x is nested array
    System.out.print(x[i] + "\t");
    ++i;
  }
  System.out.println();//new line after each row
 }//closing for loop
